# Contributing

Please be nice.

### Issues

Please open bugs using GitHub. Please provide a `pytest` style unit
test that reproduces the issue if at all possible.

### PRs

Please feel free to fork and make PRs from your fork.

### Code style

We use `pytest` for running tests and aim for 100% code coverage since
this is a pure library.

All code must have appropriate static type annotations that work with
`mypy`.

Please `pre-commit install` before making any commits. Our style
guidelines will be enforced by those [hooks](https://pre-commit.com/).

### Suggestions and comments

We're interested to hear what you think and what you'd do
differently. You can open a GitHub issue for general feedback as well.
